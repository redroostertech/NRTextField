# NRTextField

# Installation
The easiest way to install this framework is to drag and drop the NRTextField.swift file into your project. This also prevents the frameworks problem in iOS where the IBInspectable and IBDesignable are stripped out.

# Requirements
iOS 9

# Interface Builder
The library is a simple drop-in. As soon as you set your subclass to NRTextField you will be able to see all the IBDesignable settings in the storyboard.
